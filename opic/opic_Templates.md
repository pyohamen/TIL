I live in an apartment with my family over five years.
There are three bedrooms and two bathrooms.
There is also a kitchen, a living room, and a utansil room.
3 -------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Among them, my favorit room is my own bedroom.
I like my roome the most because it is the best place to get some rest.
I can kick back and relax in my room.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

There are many types of furniture in my apartment
In the living roome, I have a sofa, TV and coffee machine.
In my bedroom, I have a bed, a desk, a chair and a night stand.

Among them, my favorite furniture is my bed, because I really love to sleep.
I have had that bed for about five years.
It is very comfy and cozy so, it helps me get a quality sleep.
I think getting a good sleep is very important.
So, I need to get at least seven hours of sleep each day.
I always make my bed when I wake up in the morning.
I like to make my bed nice and tidy.

So, these are the furniture I have at home.

I remember having several probloems with my furniture over the years.

Once, I remember when my chair got damaged.
One of the legs broke and felled off.
It was impossible to fix it.
So, I had to do throw it away.
I eventually got a new chair.

Plus, I remember when my desk got a scratch.
There are some scratch marks and the paint peeled off.
It did not look good. So, I covered it up.

What else? I remember my bed got a stain.
I spilled something on it by mistake. I think it was milk.
I swiped off as soon as I could. But, It left a stain.

So, these are the problems with my furniture.

---

Frankly, my parents and I do not solve problems at home differently.

First, we deal with small problems ourselves.
For example,
~
On the other hand, when there are bigger problems at home, we get help from professionals.

Once again, we do not solve problems at home that differently.

Garbage is a big problem in every country.
It cause environmental pollution and destroys nature.

Among them, plastic takes a long time to decompose in nature.
So, recycling is one of the best ways to deal with plastic waste.
It is eco-friendly because we can reduce trashs and we can reuse our resources.

Meanwhile, Korea is a good example when it comes to recycling.
It is well-practiced at people's lives.
It has become a daily routine in people's home.

These days, people are also trying to use less disposable containers.
This helps reduce the amount of garbage we throw out.

Once again, Koreans practice recycling quite well.
I think people are more and more concisous about recycling

I have two types of trash cans.
One is for regular garbage and the other is for the recyclables.

I gather plastic bottles and cans there.
And then, I toss them in the the recycling bin.
I also gather scrap paper, boxes and disposable containers.

And then, I take them out separately.
I think I do that once or twice a week on average.
I usually do that on my way out.

Meanwhile, there is a designed area for the recycling.
It is next to the dumster for regular garbage.

So, this is how I recycle at home.

Back in the day, people did not think recycling was important.
They did not recycle at home because there is no recycling policy.
People just took out the recyclables with the other garbage.

However, recycling was practiced at schools.
Students separated the recyclables and the non-recyclables.
They sometimes took the scrap paper to school for collection.

But these days, people's views have changed a lot.
They are more conscious about environmental issues.
They think recycling is very important for the environment.

So, recycling is well-practiced at people's homes.
It has become a part of our daily lives.

I remember having a family gathering at home.
We invited some relatives over for dinner.

We used a food delivery app to order delivery.
These apps are very convenient.
It takes much less time and effort to order in.
First, we can pay for the food directly on the app.
Plus, the delivery address is already stored on the app.
Also, the app tells you how long it will take.

Before we ate, I helped set up the table.
And then, we all sat down and had dinner together.
The food tasted extra good because I was starving.

Looking back, it was a very memorable day.

I go to American fast food places from time to time.
Among them, I go to burger chains most often.
When I go there, I know what to get in advance, because they have a pre-set menu.

I normally order a burger combo, which is one of their signature menus.
I get a soft drink or a milkshake for the drink.
I sometimes get French fries or onion rings as a side dish.
I sometimes order chicken nuggets, chicken wings, chicken tenders or drumsticks.
I sometimes get biscuits or ice cream.

Fast food tastes amazing especially when I am starving.
The french fries are so crispy.
Other side dishes are very tasty as well.

So, this is one of my favorite foreign restaurants.

---

I can still remember how good the food was.
It still stands out in my memory.

Looking back, it was one of the most memorable fast food places in my childhood

People use food delivery apps to order in these days.
Ordering in has become a lot easier than in the past.

There are tons of menus on these apps, so there are a lot of options to choose from.
Sometimes, it is hard to pick because there are so many menus.

These apps are very easy to use and I think that is why so many people use them.
It takes much less time and effort to order in.
People can pay for the food directly on the app.
The delivery address is already stored on the app.
The app also tells you how long it will take, which is very useful.

I remember watching the news about the coronavirus outbreak.
It was about the rapid spread of the virus all across the world.
The virus was highly contagious and spread at an alarming rate.
The WHO declared a global pandemic and called for measures to contain the virus.

In the initial stages, the situation was especially bad in European countries such as ~.
Overall, there were more than 80 million confirmed cases worldwide.
The global death toll went over 1.8 million and it is still rising.

Some coronavirus vaccines from Pfizer, Modena, and AstraZeneca have been approved and healthcare workers are getting vaccinated first.

That being said, I hope that the coronavirus will die off eventually, sooner than later.

Well, the coronavirus can not be excepted when we talk about restaurant.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
As the virus spread, it has had a huge impact on our daily lives.
First, we had to minimize person-to-person contact.
People were told to avoid crowded places such as bars, clubs and karaokes.
In fact, businesses were forced to shut down when the number of new cases picked.

Next, many companies made their staff work from home.
Work meetings took place through video conferences, using programs like ZOOM.

Most importantly, people were asked to clean their hands well as often as they could.
Hand sanitizers were set up in almost all places, including elevators.

In the end, the coronavirus changed our lives drastically.
Some changes will become permanent and things may never come back to normal.

Frankly, gatherings and celebrations have not changed that much over the years.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------#
#------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Frankly, gatherings are pretty much the same wherever you are.
It does not matter if you live in a big city or a small town.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------#
People often have gatherings, celebrations or parties at bars or restaurants.
First, they typically have social gatherings.
When they get together, they grab some drinks with their friends.
Drinks break the ice and loosen up the mood.

Plus, people have staff-dinners at bars or restaurants as well.
It is a great chance to bond with their co-workers.
They can get closer after they have some drinks together.

Also, people gather for after-parties as well.
These parties are normally held after a main event.

What else? I think people get together for special occasions such as birthday parties.
I think drinks spice up the mood at these events. They really do!
#------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
However, these days, it is not safe to have large gatherings due to the coronavirus.

I remember watching the news about COVID-19.

The virus had a deep and widespread economic impact.
Many nations had to impose strong social distancing measures to contain the virus.
Some even had nation-wide lockdowns and close down their borders.
This had a devastating effect on local economies and people's livelihoods.

The virus also took a huge toll on large businesses as many of them had to shut down.
Small and medium-sized businesses also took a big hit.
Millions of people lost their jobs as companies had to lay off their employees.

In the end, the coronavirus had major ripple effects on the global economy.
I hope that the economy could come back to normal as soon as possible.
