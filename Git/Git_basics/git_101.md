# Git 101

* **what is Git ?**
  * **Git** is a [distributed version-control](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed_version_control) system for tracking changes in [source code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Source_code) during [software development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_development). It is designed for coordinating work among [programmers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programmer), but it can be used to track changes in any set of [files](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_file). Its goals include speed, [data integrity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_integrity), and support for distributed, non-linear workflows.
